# 🚀 Satellite Orbit Simulation

## 📌 Project Description

This project simulates the motion of satellites orbiting around the Earth using fundamental principles of orbital mechanics. The simulation visually demonstrates how a satellite moves in a curved path due to the gravitational force exerted by the Earth.

The Earth is placed at the center, and satellites revolve around it in real time, showing how velocity and gravity combine to maintain stable orbits.

## 🧠 Explanation of the Simulation

### 🌍 What is an Orbit?

An orbit is the path followed by an object around a massive body like Earth due to gravitational attraction. In this simulation, satellites follow circular paths around the Earth.

---

### 🛰️ Why Do Satellites Orbit the Earth?

Satellites remain in orbit because of the balance between:

* **Gravitational Force** → pulls the satellite toward Earth
* **Forward Velocity** → keeps the satellite moving ahead

This balance prevents the satellite from falling straight down and results in continuous orbital motion.

### ⚡ Physics Used

#### 🔹 Newton’s Law of Gravitation

F = GMm / r²

Where:

* G → Gravitational constant
* M → Mass of Earth
* m → Mass of satellite
* r → Distance from Earth's center

This force pulls the satellite inward.

---

#### 🔹 Orbital Velocity

v = √(GM / r)

This velocity ensures that the satellite stays in orbit.

---

#### 🔹 Motion Calculation

The simulation updates the satellite’s motion step-by-step using:

* Acceleration due to gravity
* Velocity updates
* Position updates over time

This creates a smooth and continuous orbit.

## 🛰️ Satellite Configuration Details

| Satellite | Color | Initial Radius (m) | Initial Velocity (m/s) | Orbit Type | Description |
|----------|------|--------------------|------------------------|------------|------------|
| Satellite 1 | 🔴 Red | 7 × 10⁶ | 7700 | Near-circular | Inner satellite with stable orbit closer to Earth |
| Satellite 2 | 🟢 Green | 8 × 10⁶ | 7200 | Near-circular | Outer satellite with slower velocity and larger orbit |

---

### 🧠 Notes:
- Satellites closer to Earth require **higher velocity** to maintain orbit  
- Satellites farther away move with **lower velocity**  
- Changing velocity affects orbit shape (circular → elliptical → escape)
